# NextTask
NextTask is a cool randomizer.

#Intended use:

This is for a specific type of people like me who enjoy reading books and solving exercises in a random direction while also keeping track of your progress and getting a sense of accomplishment by the end of the day. Reading a book from start to finish can be a very daunting way to tuckle a difficult science book for example while starting a random exercise and making a goal to finish it will make you learn many different topics from differents parts of the book in order to finish it. This way you learn things faster in a more fulfilling way.

The randomizer adds a fun way to learn things because you will likely be learning entirely different things every time you roll the randomizer. It definitely helps me.


Example name input: Thermodynamics

Example weight input: 1

The more weight the more likely it will be picked.

Example On/Off input: 1

1 for keeping task in randomizer selection and 0 for ignoring from selection

Example randomizer input: Chapter [1-20], character[a-z], characetrs[aaa-zzzz]

You can hold part of the randomizer result to keep that specific result and randomizer the rest.

You can edit a specific column by clicking the name, weight, on/off or randomizer label and selecting update selected to update only that part of the task.


I learned how to make the treeview and a lot about tkinter from Codemy.com on youtube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9seoA3Mv4Y)
