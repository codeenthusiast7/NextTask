# NextTask
NextTask is a cool randomizer.

Example name input: Task1

Example weight input: 1

The more weight the more likely it will be picked.

Example On/Off input: 1

1 for keeping in randomizer selection and 0 for ignoring from selection

Example randomizer input: Chapter [1-20], character[a-z], characetrs[aaa-zzzz]

You can hold part of the randomizer result to keep that specific result and randomizer the rest.

I learn how to make the treeview and a lot about tkinter from Codemy.com on youtube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9seoA3Mv4Y)
